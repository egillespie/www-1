Arch takes a functional style approach with central immutable state\narchitecture inspired by [Om](https://github.com/omcljs/om).\n\nArch applications are written in [LiveScript](http://livescript.net)\nby default (read more about [the reasoning](docs/07-livescript.md)\nbehind the decision), they are fully isomorphic out of the box and\nArch comes with it's own Node.js based server, Webpack bundler\nand a CLI to help you get started.\n\n## Video\n\nWatch Arch [introduction talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHNv1ymaXSU) by Viktor and Tiago at React London Meetup.\n\n## Examples\n\nFor example code, see [demos from the introduction talk](http://github.com/charypar/arch-talk)\nat London React Meetup.\n\n## Get Started\n\nStart by installing the Arch CLI\n\n```\n$ npm install -g arch-cli\n```\n\nThen create a directory for your new application and go inside\n\n```\n$ mkdir my-app &&Â cd my-app\n```\n\nYou can then generate a new app by running\n\n```\narch-cli init\n```\n\nand following the steps. When done start the application by running\n\n```\narch-cli serve\n```\n\nyour application is now running on <http://localhost:3000>.\n\n## Documentation\n\nArch doesn't have a website yet, but you can [read the\ndocumentation](docs/) (which is mostly complete)\n",
