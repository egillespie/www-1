      <p>The mission of the Lansing Chapter of ISSA is to increase the security knowledge of information professionals. We aim to improve our members' professional careers through the sharing and dispersing of information security practices. By responding to the needs of those interested in security, we will disseminate pertinent timely information through expert speakers, seminars and networking events.</p>
      <p>We recognize that information security can only be successfully addressed if we have clear and concise goals. To this extent, our goal is to become Lansing's clear choice for security information.</p>
